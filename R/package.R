#' holodeck: A package for simulating multivariate datasets
#'
#' The `holodeck` package contains functions for creating "chunks" of variables with different degrees of co-variance (collinearity) and discrimination among groups (i.e. levels of a categorical variable).
#'
#' What make it 'tidy'?  All `sim_*` functions accept dataframes or tibbles as their first argument and return tibbles, meaning they work with the pipe operator (`%>%`) from the `dplyr` package.
